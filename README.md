# E-Commerce for Texas State University
I developed a Django-based e-commerce platform as part of a course project, enabling users(students) to browse products, manage carts, place orders, provide feedback, engage in chat, and express preferences through likes/dislikes. The application includes user authentication, administrative controls, product recommendations, and order tracking features.
